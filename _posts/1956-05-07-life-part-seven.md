Life on earth originated 3.5 billion years ago. It will take almost 3 billion years for those single-celled organisms with a primitive cell structure to evolve into single-celled organisms with a real nucleus. In the last 500 million years, multicellular organisms have formed and real life (as we know it) begins to develop.

# An overview captured in a kind of timepiece.

Earth's history takes up an enormous amount of time. To be able to depict this, the 4.6 billion years that our planet is old is sometimes compared to a <span style="color: red;">clockwork</span>, a so-called geological clock.

On this clock the evolution of the Earth and the origin of life is <span style="color: red;">summarized</span> from midnight to midnight. So in 24 hours everything passes by:
* An <u>hour</u> on the clock is actually 416 million years.
* One <u>minute</u> is almost 7 million years.
* One <u>second</u> is 115555 years.

What does this <span style="color: red;">yield</span>:
* The first life arises around <u>03h15</u>. 
* Only at <u>12h00</u> the atmosphere starts to contain oxygen.
* At <u>16h00</u> the first primitive sea creatures arrive. 
* The Cambrian explosion takes place at <u>20h45</u>.
* And at <u>22h00</u>, during the Devonian, the first life appears in the land. 
* The dinosaurs die out at <u>23h40</u>.
* The first people do not appear until <u>20 seconds before midnight</u>.
