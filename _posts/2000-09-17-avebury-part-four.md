Here are the details of the entire  Avebury Site.

# Some generalities.
The Avebury Stone Circle and the Avebury Site are located about 40 km north of Stonehenge.

Only the car park has to be paid for. Access is free.

The entire site is extensive and it is difficult to get a global picture of it. However, you will appreciate this place, because it has a charm that Stonehenge no longer has (although the site in Avebury is also very popular in high season).

Broadly speaking, there are 3 sources of information:
* <u>John Aubrey</u> spoke in 1648 about Avebury in terms of a cathedral and about Stonehenge in terms of parish church. He discovered the monument during a fox hunt and was commissioned by his King Charles II to study it. In September 1663 he gave an initial scientific description. He gathered information about the stones, much of which would disappear in puritanical England.
* In the following century it was <u>William Stukeley</u>, also an ancient and spiritual science student, who discovered that the complex with the access roads had been constructed in the form of a snake. In many cultures, this is the symbol of spiritual energy. To him, Avebury was a temple to the druids. He wrote an extensive work about it but had to experience during his lifetime that several stones were destroyed.
* At the beginning of the 20th century it was mainly <u>Alexander Keiller</u> who was the first to do real archaeological research. He tried to save what was salvageable and before that he bought up the whole site. The local Alexander Keiller Museum in the former abbey gives an interesting overview (a model) of all the prehistoric monuments in the area.

# Overall picture.
The entire site is much larger than the large circle and consisted of about 600 megaliths. More than half have since disappeared (because the villagers used the stones as building material in the 18th century) and another half of them are upright (possibly in the right place). The entire site includes:
* The large circle with ditch and earthen shore – <span style="color: blue;">The Avebury Stone Circle</span>. 
* Two access roads – <span style="color: blue;">The West Kennet Avenue and the Beckhampton Avenue</span>. 
* An away place – <span style="color: blue;">The Sanctuary</span>. 
* A limestone hill – <span style="color: blue;">The Silbury Hill</span>. 
* A cemetery – <span style="color: blue;">The West Kennet Long Barrow</span>. 
* A settlement – <span style="color: blue;">The Windmill Hill</span>. 

<span style="color: blue;">The Avebury Stone Circle</span>. 

For this I like to refer to part 3 of my blog: The Avebury Stone Circle, many details.

<span style="color: blue;">The West Kennet Avenue and the Beckhampton Avenue</span>. 

There is a first access road and it starts at the southern passage of the circle. This winding avenue leads about 2.5 km to the Sanctuary just east of the village of West Kennet. This is the so-called West Kennet Avenue. The avenue is considered a processional road:
* Over the entire length there was a double row of upright stones, for this one used slightly smaller stones than those of the circle itself. They stood in <u>pairs</u>, 100 in total and every 25 m. Between each pair the avenue was 15 m wide. Each pair had two shapes:
	* Narrow, round and larger as a symbol of <u>masculinity</u>.
	* Wide, triangular and smaller as a symbol of <u>femininity</u>. 
* It must be said that these stones too soon became victims of the <u>advancing civilization</u>. Farmers have been ploughing the ground around here for centuries and they didn't see the point of these stones. Driving inside on the B4003 we get a view of some of these paired stones. Over a length of about 300 m. 27 stones were upright during the restoration and 37 others were marked with a concrete stump. So it's a glimpse of the original 200 stone arrangement.
* At the base of some stones, Alexander Keiller found four shallow <u>burials</u> in 1930. Six individuals could be located and the pottery referred to the bell cup people. They may have belonged to the elite.

There is a second access road, also a processional road and which begins at the western passage of the circle. This avenue leads about 1 km to the west to a Long Barrow. This is the so-called Beckhampton Avenue:
* Excavations in 2000 showed that a pattern of paired stones was also <u>present</u> here along the entire length. But this avenue has been saved much worse by its fate and barely 100 m has been partially resurrected.
* The fact that this road led to a <u>cemetery</u> and that there were also burials along the avenue, helped in the decision to classify Avebury as a ritual place of death, life and fertility. 
* And it could possibly be <u>extended</u> to other Barrows.

<span style="color: blue;">The Sanctuary</span>. 

In a first version in 3000 BC, wooden poles would have been laid in several wreaths. The smallest circle of almost 5 m wide was probably a covered place, a hut for a master/priest. 

In a later phase around 2800 BC, the sanctuary consisted of two concentric circles of stones:
* The <u>outer one</u> had a center line of about 40 m and was connected to the Stone Circle via West Kennet Avenue. 
* The <u>interior</u> was about 15 m wide and circled the small central covered building where possibly still a wise man lived. Another 100 years later, that central house was expanded and at least partially erected in stone.

All the stones of the sanctuary were knocked down and smashed by one farmer with whom the bucket had apparently overflowed in the mid-18th century. 

Archaeologists have marked the perimeter of the shrine with small flat stones. In the soil itself many traces of human activity have been found (bell cup pottery, food scraps and bones).  

The sanctuary can be seen from the road.

<span style="color: blue;">The Silbury Hill</span>. 

Two kilometres south is Silbury Hill Round Barrow, the highest man-made hill in Europe. The height is 40 m, the diameter is 168 m and the circumference is 0.5 km. In its ground surface fits an entire football field. The hill used to be climbed via a narrow path, now there is a small parking for the view.

The hill is dated by means of the radio-carbon method around 2700 BC. We are in the Neolithic or New Stone Age.  The hill owes its stability to the fact that the builders internally applied a kind of honeycomb structure of limestone, which required no less than 500 000 tons. 500 people should have worked on this day in and day out for ten years. It is believed that the hill was built in stages and thus systematically increased.

However, the purpose of the hill is not fully known:
* <u>Archaeological</u> research has not yielded any traces of burial chambers. It may have been a sanctuary, a sacrificial place or had an astronomical function.
* In the <u>Roman</u> period, a settlement was formed at the foot of the hill.
* In the ensuing <u>Saxon</u> period, the hill was flattened and used as a vantage point.

In modern times, the hill was examined several times:
* In <u>1776</u> miners dug a vertical shaft in the middle of the hill. They were looking for a central burial chamber, but they didn't find anything.
* In <u>1849</u> a horizontal tunnel was drilled, but again nothing was found.
* The result of these ill-considered interventions led in <u>2000</u> to the collapse of the summit and the opening of a 45 m deep crater. It took a lot of money to close the opening with the help of a helicopter, but it did produce a nice reportage.

Recently a bold feature appeared. The hill would have been significantly a few meters higher earlier. The top is rained out, this is possible. It would have been placed on it at the time, which served as a lightning rod. The electrical discharges to the ground ionized the Earth. The inner skeleton of lime provided a good conduction. The acidic environment became (temporarily) more basic and in it plants can better get their nutrients and thus grow better. This process and thus better agriculture would have an effect on such a 16 square kilometre. Say 4 km by 4 km and with that the whole neolithic settlement is covered. 

The fact that the hill is less high today reduces the chance of a lightning strike. It is thought that The White Horse in the area may have taken over that function. And so we get an explanation for the phenomenon of White Horses in these areas. 

<span style="color: blue;">The West Kennet Long Barrow</span>. 

One kilometre further south is West Kennet Long Barrow. Such a Long Barrow is an older and elongated burial mound, 100 m long and 20 m wide. So this is a real burial mound that was put into use around 3700 BC:
* In front of the entrance there is a <u>small open space</u> where people probably gathered, before the burial took place.
* The narrow entrance is marked by <u>3 huge megaliths</u>.
* Inside, 5 stone rooms were decorated. Afterwards, everything was <u>covered</u> with tons of sand.

Traces of at least 35 different individuals were found in those chambers. It's possible that each room represented some kind of social status. Everything is emptied and one can take a look inside freely. 

The Barrow exhibits an east-west orientation and the connection with the sunrise/sunset can be made.

There is a crop circle around here from time to time. The creators are well known and come out for it.

<span style="color: blue;">The Windmill Hill</span>. 

Two kilometres north is Windmill Hill. It is a fairly extensive settlement on a hill, cordoned off by 3 circular canals and earthen ramparts. 

At the end of the 19th century there were plans to set up a cell tower here. Alexander Keiller prevented that. He saw the archaeological value and bought up the area. He excavated it until 1925 and gave name and meaning to this site after which the Neolithic Windmill Hill culture is named. This Neolithic man was a farmer:
* He <u>grew</u> wheat and barley.
* He <u>bred</u> cattle, sheep, pigs and goats.
* He <u>made</u> flint bees, arrowheads and scrapers. 
* He <u>buried</u> the dead.

The occupation can be situated between 3700 and 2500 BC, possibly a little longer. A lot of bell cup pottery was found here, typical of windmill hill culture:
* Probably the pottery dates from the last period around 2500 BC, around that time the so-called <u>bell cup people</u> from the mainland arrived in this area.
* These people and their descendants are <u>building</u> the circle and will finish Stonehenge a few centuries later.

At the same time as this settlement, construction and commissioning of the so-called West Kennet Long Barrow began.
