One tipping point follows another. It is a house of cards, one failure causes the entire system to collapse. We go over the so-called geological times determined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).

# Precambrian > 4600-542 million years ago.
The newly formed earth must first <span style="color: red;">cool down</span> with water vapor condensing into the oceans, this process takes about 1000 million years.

3500 million years ago, the so-called <span style="color: red;">primordial soup</span> is a fact. It is a fickle brew where the oldest fossil bacteria occur. Their core is simple and one speaks of prokaryotes.

2600 million years ago, these bacteria also occur on land, but this is a sidetrack. The majority stays in the water and <span style="color: red;">evolves</span>:
* For example, they contain <u>chlorophyll</u> a little later (green bacteria).
* They <u>cohabit</u> together to form the first multicellular organisms.
* And the very first <u>photosynthesis</u> takes place.

1700 million years ago the first eukaryotes occur, they have a <span style="color: red;">modern nucleus</span> with genetic material. Gradually there are algae, protozoa, sponges and cavity animals.
# Cambrian > 542-488 million years ago.
There is an <span style="color: red;">explosion</span> of life.

Especially the <span style="color: red;">seaweeds</span> are doing extremely well, the primordial soup looks green.

In a relatively short time, all strains of the <span style="color: red;">invertebrates</span> arise. We get flatworms, round worms, rotifers, echinoderms, articulated worms, mollusks and arthropods. The oldest arthropods, the trilobites, still occur today.

The organisms without an external skeleton can do their gas exchange by simple diffusion. The organisms with an external skeleton develop <span style="color: red;">gills</span> for their gas exchange.

# Ordovician > 488-443 million years ago.
The Ordovician was a period with a relatively warm climate and a high sea level. Life still takes place mainly in the <span style="color: red;">water</span>:
* The <u>squid</u> are flourishing, they are not cuties. They install the system of hunter and prey.
* The first vertebrates such as the <u>jawless fish</u> appear. Of these organisms, the or lampreys remain today.

# Silurian > 443-416 million years ago.
Now the first plants appear on the land, probably in the <span style="color: red;">tidal zone</span>. They develop:
* <u>Supporting tissue</u> to stay upright.
* <u>Vascular bundles</u> to bring water from the roots to the leaves. With their roots, they can penetrate deeper and deeper into the land.

# Devonian > 416-360 million years ago.
The sea level drops spectacularly and there are drought periods. Now comes a wide variety of <span style="color: red;">cartilaginous</span> fish:
* Important are the <u>lungfish</u>. In addition to gills, they also develop lungs. This allows them to survive a drought. For their reproduction they have to go back to the water and that is probably how the first amphibians arise.
* There are also the brush fins, the best known example is the current <u>coelacanth</u>. His fins for swimming in the water will later be transformed into fins (legs) to crawl on land.

On land, the giant horsetails and ferns arise. They are both <span style="color: red;">spore</span> plants that need moisture for their reproduction. The earth is covered with the first forests, the land sees green.

# Carboniferous > 360-300 million years ago.
It's warm on earth. More and more animals are <span style="color: red;">migrating</span> from the water to the land. Their external armor protects against dehydration, In addition to lung-like structures, trachea tubes arise as in the insects and spiders. Both groups flourish, giant insects manage to fly in the air, it would be no fun for humans.

The amphibians begin to lay eggs with a kind of leather shell. From now on they can reproduce on the land and that is how we arrive at the first <span style="color: red;">reptiles</span>.  

The first <span style="color: red;">seed</span> plants appear, they are nudibranchs who carry their seeds virtually unprotected. Together with the ferns, they are at the origin of the fossil fuels on our planet.

# Perm > 300-250 million years ago.
A <span style="color: red;">cool</span> period is coming, ice caps cover the land. The ice-free land areas around the equator remain covered with spore plants and nudibranchs.

But a <span style="color: red;">mass extinction</span> is taking place in which many species disappear forever:
* It's just too <u>cold</u>, The animals with a changing body temperature can't get going.
* Sea levels are <u>falling</u> to the current record level, large areas are frozen.
* The earth's interior needs to let off steam and there is strong <u>volcanic</u> activity.

# Triassic > 250-200 million years ago.
It gets <span style="color: red;">warm again</span> on earth. The nudibranchs are still doing well. The first pines arise, they already carry their seeds a little better protected in a cone.

The <span style="color: red;">reptiles</span> develop extremely strongly on the mainland. They begin to take on enormous proportions and learn to fly. Their brains remain extraordinarily small in relation to their size. There are benign herbivores and terrible predators.

A branch of the reptiles evolves in the direction of the mammals. They remain small but their warm-blooded household is an unprecedented <span style="color: red;">advantage</span>.

# Jurassic > 200-145 million years ago.
This is the flowering period of the <span style="color: red;">dinosaurs</span>, these giant reptiles rule the earth.

At the end of the Jurassic, the primal bird <span style="color: red;">Archaeopteryx</span> appears. In addition to characteristics of the reptiles, we also find characteristics of the later birds.

# Cretaceous > 145-66 million years ago.
Once again, the climate becomes cooler and drier. The very first nudibranch plants are having a hard time, the conifers are better armed against this change. Now comes the time of modern <span style="color: red;">flowering</span> plants, huge forests of deciduous trees cover the earth.

Shorter <span style="color: red;">ice ages</span> are starting, the giant reptiles are having a hard time. For the herbivores there is a threat of a food shortage. And 65 million years ago, a huge asteroid impact was fatal to them, they suddenly disappear from the face of the earth.

The small mammals seize their chance. Because of their <span style="color: red;">warm-blooded</span> system (a very expensive joke) they can come to the fore. Many new species are emerging, many survive in slightly modified form to this day.

The <span style="color: red;">birds</span> are also present. They have also opted for the warm-blooded system and derive indispensable benefit from it.

# Today > 66-0 million years ago.
After the Cretaceous there are no more <span style="color: red;">spectacular</span> changes in the plants and the animals, they do evolve, but that is rather small:
* From the <u>primates</u> come the first hominids, the last 4 million years will be needed to come to modern man.
* Some mammals <u>return</u> to the water, the whales are the best known example.
* Also, some mammals learn to <u>fly</u>.
