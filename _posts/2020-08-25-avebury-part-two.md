In this section we go into more detail about all the details of the Avebury site.

**Some generalities.**

The Avebury Stone Circle and the Avebury Site are located about 40 km north of Stonehenge. Only the car park has to be paid for. Access to the site itself is free. 

Due to the vastness of the entire site, it is difficult to get a global picture of the site, especially since the villagers used the stones as building material in the 18th century. However, you will appreciate this place, because it has a charm that Stonehenge no longer has (although the site in Avebury is also very popular in high season).

A must is a visit to the Alexander Keiller Museum in the former abbey. There all the information is collected about the entire site.  

Avebury is a village in Great Britain in the English county of Wiltshire. It is located 2 km north of the road from London to Bath. There are about 500 inhabitants. The village is known for being partly located in 'The Ring of Avebury', the largest so-called henge monument in England. The cute village is surrounded by an area of eleven hectares full of stones and earthen ramparts dating from around 2000 BC:
- John Aubrey spoke in 1648 about Avebury in terms of a cathedral and about Stonehenge in terms of parish church. He discovered the monument during a fox hunt and was commissioned by King Charles II to study it. 
- In the following century it was William Stukeley, also an ancient and spiritual science student, who discovered that the complex had been constructed in the form of a serpent. In many cultures, this is the symbol of spiritual energy.

Unlike Stonehenge, which was built for the worship of the moon and the sun, the construction of Avebury seems more to be related to fertility, life and death. There is a lot of evidence that Avebury was often used for funeral ceremonies. The male columnar and female triangular stones of the entrance skips are deliberately placed together to reveal the link between fertility and death through these highly sexually charged symbols. The celebration of the cycle of birth, life and death took in the thinking of the Neolithic man a key place. The rituals of Avebury were therefore intended to bring happiness to the living and to give the dead new life.

**A word of history.**

Construction began around 2600 BC, several hundred years after the first phase of construction in stonehenge wood. The complex was used and expanded over a period of about a thousand years. So it was more quickly finished than Stonehenge, the construction is also easier to build and so the stone circle itself is a bit older than the stone construction in Stonehenge.

As with Stonehenge, a henge was first built at Avebury: a ring wall and ring moat. Originally the shore was no less than 17 m high. Although that is no longer the case, he still looks impressive. With a diameter of 370 m, this henge is also the widest in the whole country. The village of Avebury is in the middle of it. The church and the abbey building/museum are located just outside the henge. 

The finds of bell cup pottery in ditches and pits, which are related to the stones, make it likely that the stone circles were erected between 2000 and 1800 BC. The first construction of 'The Ring' is probably a few centuries older and would have happened with wooden poles. The local Alexander Keiller Museum gives an interesting overview of all the prehistoric monuments in the area. The model of the entire complex pays off. 

The mere fact that the stones in Avebury are unprocessed makes it plausible that they are older than those of Stonehenge. It is estimated that those of Stonehenge were placed around 1500 BC. It was only then that people apparently knew the technique of machining stones. 

Rounded may we say:             
- For Avebury, this period belongs to the very last phase of the Neolithic or New Stone Age or about 2000 BC.   
- For Stonehenge, this period belongs to the early stages of the Bronze Age or about 1500 BC.

**The transport.**

It is very clear how these huge stones were transported and then put upright. All are from the nearby Marlborough Downs. From that same area come also the imposing stones of Stonehenge. The megaliths of Avebury and Stonehenge are called Sarsen:
- The people had sufficient knowledge and it is likely that they used wooden rollers to transport the stones. Hundreds of people and dozens of oxen were present. They have undoubtedly followed a route with as few steep slopes and dangerous descents as possible. Such a route can be found at that 20 km distance.
- It is also not possible to rule out that part of the route was done by water. The River Kennet offered that opportunity. The knowledge to build a raft was certainly available.
	
Once the stones were at their destination, they were placed in a deep hole using wooden rollers, ropes and levers. Around the base of the stones, lime and earth were rammed to hold them in place. 
It may have taken about one year to finally put one stone in place and 600 people had to work together.

**The construction itself.**

The entire site is much larger than the circle and consisted of about 600 megaliths. More than half have since disappeared and another half are standing upright and possibly in the right place. The entire site includes:
- The circle with ditch and earthen shore – **The Avebury Stone Circle**.
- Two access roads – **The West Kennet Avenue and the Beckhampton Avenue**.
- The sanctuary – **The Sanctuary**.
- A limestone hill – **The Silbury Hill**.
- A cemetery – **The West Kennet Long Barrow**.
- A settlement – **The Windmill Hill**.

**The Avebury Stone Circle.**

The circle is not quite perfect. Most likely this was done deliberately because one could certainly easily make a perfect circle with a wooden pole and a rope. The diameter is kept at 400 m.  

They used solid, unprocessed stones. One sees that the stones with their smooth side, so to speak the most eroded side, are placed inwards. It is the largest of its kind and the second largest in the world. The village of Avebury overlaps a part of the circle where stones once stood.  

As already mentioned, the circle itself consisted of about 100 stones and there are less than 30 of them left, 28 to be exact. These are by far the largest stones. The other stones on the site range in size from 2.1 to 5.5 meters. They range in weight from 10 to 60 tons. 

In the northern and southern half of this circle there were two smaller (diameter about 100 m) circles of standing stones within which other stones were erected. In the pattern of these last stones, there is now no regularity or system to be seen. Their intention is also not clear and the High Street simply runs between the two smaller circles. They are called the northern and southern circle and they are perfectly circular. Presumably they are 100 years older than the large surrounding circle:
	- The northern circle is 99 meters in diameter and originally consisted of 27 stones, of which four are still standing today. 
	- The southern circle is 105 meters in diameter and has 29 stones, five of which are still in place. Merlin of England calls the northern circle the 'sun circle' and the southern one the 'moon circle'. With this he refers to a possible calendar function. This is generally little accepted.

Around the entire monument lies an original nearly 10 m deep ditch and beyond a high earthen wall, for which it was intended is not really clear but since it is on the outside defense seems unlikely. Shore and ditch were most likely first laid out and the rest followed in phases. Bones were used to loosen the ground and so used the shoulder blade of a deer as a shovel. Shore and ditch are interrupted in four places (the four corners of the wind) and thus mark entrances and exits. Everywhere excavation has shown that this was the original design, currently modern roads walk through it. It should be noted that due to the presence of the lime in the subsoil, both the ditch and the shore came across snow white, a striking caress for the eye.

Some special stones:
- There is to begin with the Barber Stone (Stone Number 9). Here, 800 years ago, a hairdresser would have died trying to bury the stone, so he would have fallen under it. The stone is located in the southwestern part of the circle. He is thus put back upright in 1830 by Alexander Keiller and the body of the unfortunate one is removed. A pair of scissors was found on the body, which gave rise to the name Barber Stone. Coins were also found an important tool to date the skeleton to some 1200 AD. Charlie was transferred to the Natural History Museum in London. The holes in the stone would have been caused by the roots of plants. 
- There is the so-called Devil's Chair (Stone Number 1). He's got a clear seat. Women made their intimate wishes here at times when the day and night were equally long. The stone is located where West Kennet Avenue joins the circle.                                                                                                           
- The heaviest megalith is one that stands in the Cove. Cove means a sheltered place, we are here in the middle of the north circle and maybe this was the place where the rituals were performed. It is believed that low chanting is reflected within that stone spot. The Cove consists of three stones. The largest is clearly a female stone and is therefore called Eve (Stone Number I). He'd weigh 100 tons and he'd be the biggest of its kind. Next to it is a column which is clearly a male stone and is therefore called Adam (Stone Number II). The third stone, within which the sheltered place must be situated, is missing. 
- The second heaviest megalith that has been preserved is the approximately 65 tons of Swindon Stone (Stone Number 46) which stands at the north entrance, this is the road to Swindon and along this road one can see a good example of a white horse. This giant stone has been balancing lonely on one corner for 4,000 years, because its neighbor has disappeared.                                                                                        
- There is the Ring Stone, actually a numberless stump that one can easily walk past. His name certainly refers to the use of a wedding promise here and then sealed it with a ring.
- There is also the Vulva Stone (Stone Number 105). The remarkable quarry in the stone refers without a doubt to the female sex organ. The stone is part of the south circle. 
- In the middle of the south circle would have stood an obelisk, the place is now marked by a concrete stump, a Plinth. The so-called obelisk would have had a striking length. In 1724 he was still on the ground, but he was already lying on the ground. Then it was calculated that he would have crossed more than 6 m above the ground.

**The West Kennet Avenue and the Beckhampton Avenue.**

There is a first access road and which starts at the south-east exit with a double row of upright stones, paired about 30 m apart, the so-called 'West Kennet Avenue'. As a symbol of masculinity and femininity, they had two different forms per pair, one wide and the other narrow. This avenue leads about 2 km to the Sanctuary just east of the village of West Kennet. The avenue is considered a processional road. Driving inside on the B4003 gives a view of some purple stones.           

There is a second access road, also a processional road and which leads west to a Long Barrow. This is the so-called Beckhampton Avenue. The fact that this path led to a cemetery helped in the decision to classify Avebury as a ritual place of death, life and fertility.**

**The Sanctuary.**

This sanctuary consisted of two concentric circles of stones, the outer of which had a center line of about 30 m. All the stones of the sanctuary have been knocked down and smashed. In a first version, there would have been wooden pile wreaths here. 

Archaeologists have marked the perimeter of the shrine with small flat stones. 

Many traces of human activity have been found in the ground itself. Dating dates back to 3000 BC. 

From here you could go to The Stone Circle via The West Kennet Avenue.

The sanctuary can be seen from the road. 
                                                                                                                        
**The Silbury Hill.**

Two kilometres south is Silbury Hill Round Barrow, the highest man-made hill in Europe. The height is 40 m and the diameter would be 168 m. 

The hill is dated by means of the radio-carbon method around 2700 BC. We are in the Neolithic or New Stone Age. The hill used to be climbed via a narrow path. The hill owes its stability to the fact that the builders have internally applied a kind of honeycomb structure of limestone. 500 people should have worked on this day in and day out for ten years. In its ground surface fits an entire football field. 

However, the purpose of the hill is not known. Archaeological research has yielded no traces of burial chambers. It may have been a sanctuary, a sacrificial place or had an astronomical function. 

The hill would have been significantly a few meters higher earlier. The top is rained out, this is possible. It would have been placed on it at the time, which served as a lightning rod. The electrical discharges to the ground ionized the Earth. The inner skeleton of lime provided a good conduction. The acidic environment became (temporarily) more basic and in it plants can better get their nutrients and thus grow better. This process and thus better agriculture would have an effect on such a 16 square kilometre. Say 4 km by 4 km and with that the whole neolithic settlement is covered. 

The fact that the hill is less high today reduces the chance of a lightning strike. It is thought that The White Horse in the area may have taken over that function. And so we get an explanation for the phenomenon of White Horses in these areas. 

**The West Kennet Long Barrow.**

Another mile further south is West Kennet Long Barrow. 

Such a Long Barrow is an older and elongated burial mound. So this is a real burial mound that was put into use around 3700 BC. Five burial chambers were found in it, which were subsequently covered with earth. These rooms have been emptied and they can be visited at all times, the trouble. 

Around here, a crop circle occasionally appears, the makers are well known and come out for it.   

**The Windmill Hill.**    

Two kilometres north is Windmill Hill, the site after which neolithic Windmill Hill culture is named. 

This is a fairly extensive settlement, deposited by 3 circular canals and earthen ramparts. The habitation can be situated between 3700 and 2500 BC. A lot of bell cup pottery was found here. These are the oldest traces of human presence. 

At the same time as this settlement, construction and commissioning of the so-called West Kennet Long Barrow, which is a little further south of Silbury Hill, was also started.
