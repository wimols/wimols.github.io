<span style="color: red;">Everything depends on coincidences. We do not know any better and we must accept it. Objectively speaking, improvements are possible.</span>

# Could our earth have been better?

Our earth could have been a <span style="color: red;">little bigger</span>. Due to the increased gravity, we may have been a bit smaller, which is nice. View everything on a scale of 3/4. Everything is then in a smaller constellation: body, homes, utensils, energy needs... So we might need a little less living space and resources, and at the same time they were both more available. We would have more time to turn the tide, an overcrowding was not yet lurking. Of course, we must not exaggerate in that greater Earth. Gravity then increases and there is certainly a point at which our birds would no longer be able to fly. Of course, you could also say, "What you don't know, don't bother."

Perhaps the continents could have turned slightly <span style="color: red;">differently</span> so that some more habitable surface area would have been freed up. A lot of it has now been lost, think antarctica. The inhospitable desert zone could be smaller. This continent shift has been reconstructed over the last 250 million years. There is a certain coincidence that something else could have happened, and it is precisely those last 250 million years that are crucial for us.

Above all, we must ensure that we <span style="color: red;">do not kill</span> ourselves sooner, for how long will the earth tolerate us? Our dislocated planet will avenge itself. This could happen in the near future, what is a thousand years? And that would be a great pity. A rather unique experiment in the universe is nipped in the bud by ourselves, man is a nest polluter. We have been working for so long to control the earth's ecosystem. Just one example: 45,000 years ago, man reached Australia. In this new ecosystem, he adapted without any tingling and rose to the top of the food chain in one step. He became the deadliest species in the annals of our planet, an ecological recidivism serial killer. All marsupials over 50 kg disappeared "suddenly". Does there have to be any sand?

# Is there a solar system with two habitable planets?
The discovery of no fewer than three habitable planets around the star Trappist-1 caused a lot of <span style="color: red;">turmoil</span> in 2017.

Now in our solar system there is only one planet in the habitable zone. With some luck, this could have been <span style="color: red;">different</span>. Let's take a look at Mars:
* Mars should have been a <u>bit bigger</u>. Due to the greater gravity, his atmosphere may not have disappeared and the liquid water had not evaporated. Furthermore, Mars would still have a liquid core (so not yet completely cooled). There would still be volcanism which benefits the rock formation. And there would even be a magnetic field present that can deflect harmful ion storms.
* Mars could easily have been a <u>little closer</u> to the sun without endangering our Earth. That way, the surface temperatures would be less extreme.
* People now look at Mars and dream of a kind of <u>greening process</u>. At the moment, this is more fiction than reality. But with the possible changes from above, it could certainly be a lot easier. Who knows, maybe the colonization of Mars was already a fact?

# Should we not put our own house in order?
We must above all ensure that we do not kill ourselves earlier, how long will the earth tolerate us? Our disrupted planet will avenge itself. This may happen in the near future, what is a thousand years now? And that would be a great pity. A rather unique experiment in the universe is nipped in the bud by ourselves, man is simply a <span style="color: red;">litter polluter</span>. We have been working for so long to control the earth's ecosystem. 

Just one <span style="color: red;">example</span>: 45,000 years ago man reached Australia. In this new ecosystem, he adapted without any hesitation and rose to the top of the food chain in one step. He became the deadliest species in the annals of our planet, an ecological recidivism serial killer. All marsupials weighing more than 50 kg disappeared "suddenly". Should there still be sand?
