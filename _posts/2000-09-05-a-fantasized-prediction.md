A fantasized prediction about life on Mars. 

In a first part I will explain how one got to the evidence of ancient life on Mars. Then I'll go into what evidence exactly that is. And then I tell you that it will stick to that evidence, in other words one will never, for example, find a skeleton of a mammoth on Mars.

# How did we get that evidence?

Since February 2021, there is a new Mars robot action on that planet. This one bears the name <span style="color: blue;">Perseverance</span>, which means the holder or the tenacious. It's a big robot, 1 ton heavy and the size of a vehicle. It is also much more powerful than its predecessors the Spirit, Opportunity of Curiosity. They could barely travel 200 m in one day, he can rather travel 2 km per day. He does that on those distinctive 6 wheels that hopefully evoke the right image.

NASA dropped it on a flat piece of terrain about 45 km by 50 km. Actually a circular area with hills and mountains on the edge. From the height, it's just clear that it's an impact crater. It is estimated at 3.5 billion years old. It is quite common that Mars was frequently affected by meteorite impacts at the time. The crater is not particularly large, there are still so and some are much larger. The name of the crater is Jazero or Jazera, depending on the language.

Why was this crater chosen? However, it is believed that it was once full of water. On the one hand there are deep gullies in the hills. These are parched riverbeds that once supplied the water. The crater is full and a large lake is created, rather shallow, say a few tens of meters. And on the other hand, deep gullies can once again be seen, including dried-out riverbeds that drain the water to the lower reaches of the planet.

It is estimated that water has been present for about one billion years. Two billion years ago, it disappeared quite suddenly, dried up, evaporated. So the crater has been dry all along, all that has been added is dust and sand (on Mars there are heavy dust storms covering everything, something that the former Mars robots have fallen under). It is estimated that sand layer on about 20 cm to 30 cm. So it is certainly not in this layer that one should look for life because that dust and sand have never been in contact with water.

What needs to be done now? The robot has an arm with a steel brush. It can rotate around to turn away the sand and dust in a trench. The robot moves a bit forward and then back again and in a few hours the job is done. Then another robotic arm comes into action. It is equipped with a drill with which a ground steel is taken in the original soil of that lake. One drills up to about 20 cm deep to be able to sit sufficiently in the former slip.

That ground steel is then examined on the spot in the supplied laboratory. One can beam, heat and expose the steel to solvents and the results are transmitted to the earth. 

So that's how they got that evidence of early life on Mars.

I'll add:
- To take <u>1 sample is about 1 week</u>. Travel a distance, position the robot, complete the steel name, investigate, forward and complete.
- There have already been <u>12 decreases</u>. Of these, 2 failed because the drill could not enter the ground as there happened to be a rock in the road. The drill was having difficulty getting into the rock bottom and they didn't want to force anything and they didn't want to damage anything.
- There are 10 lucky attempts left and of those 10, <u>9 are positive</u>. This means that traces of past life have already been found in 9 places. So we can speak of an overwhelming success.
- So the mission is <u>successful</u> and voices go on to send the robot to another place to do its job again. Here there is a problem, the robot can not possibly drive out of the crater on its own, think of that mountainous rim. So he's doomed to stay there for the time being.
- I can already <u>predict</u> that he will also find traces of life in other places in that crater. And that's what we're going to have to do.
- In total, the robot is equipped with raw materials to make <u>50 steel purchases</u>. This corresponds to one year. The lifespan of the robot is calculated at 2 years, of course one secretly hopes for a longer life course but that is difficult to predict (even though its predecessors have already proven that).

# What evidence have now been found?

There are two groups of <span style="color: blue;">chemical molecules</span>:
- <u>Amino acids</u> have been found. Some molecules are intact and are immediately recognized, others are fragmentary and can probably be named. We know about 20 amino acids on Earth, but 11 have already been found on Mars. So looking further into that crater certainly pays off. And then there's this: amino acids are indispensable for life as we know it on earth. With amino acids, all the proteins that shape life in us can be made.
- <u>Nucleotides</u> have been found, also partly intact and partly fragmentary. These nucleotides form the basis of the nuclear acid DNA and RNA. These macromolecules contain all the information about life, they control all life processes and can simply reproduce (and thus pass on the stored information to posterity).

So these are the evidence we can't look beyond.

# Does this evidence stick to this or can we hope for more?

It looks like it's going to stay here. I remind you that one will never find a skeleton of a mammoth.
Earth and Mars have taken a <span style="color: blue;">similar course</span>. They originated together, in a few years it does not sting. But there are two obvious differences:
- Mars was much further from our sun. In a much colder place in our solar system, that's why Mars has <u>cooled faster</u> than Earth. Faster cooling means that the volcanic activity of this planet is coming to an end. Volcanism leads to eruptions and emissions of gases that formed the first atmosphere on Mars, an atmosphere with the necessary ingredients for the emergence of life. As long as there is a liquid hot core that continues to be volcanism, the pressure must be able to be off the boiler. But that liquid core is gone (or at least as good as). With that disappearance, the magnetic field was also lost and with it the protection against the harmful eruptions of our sun. On Mars this state is already a fact, on Earth we have already gone the same way but it is not yet that far for us.
- Mars is <u>smaller</u> than our Earth. The diameter is about half the size of Earth, which means that the volume of Mars is about one-tenth that of Earth. The total area is about the same as the total land area with us. This smaller volume leads to a faster cooling and thus the problems involved. So everything went well in that billion years when liquid water was present. Life began to develop as it did with us, probably the most normal thing in the immeasurable universe. But this development came to an abrupt end when the cooling was already too far advanced. Suddenly the water and the atmosphere was gone. Life on Mars has not progressed beyond the single-celled stage. We were able to build on that, and on Mars that was not the case. Can we find that single-celled stage on Mars? It seems that this is almost impossible, cells arise and decay and leave no traces (let alone ripping) behind.

I hope to have explained enough that we should not expect a fairy tale.

# An unexpected final word.

Note that in the title I talk about a <span style="color: blue;">fantasized prediction</span>:

The <span style="color: blue;">fantasy</span> is in many things. In reality, the Perseverance doesn't have a laboratory on board. However, he must leave the samples taken somewhere safe so that they can possibly be picked up by future Mars missions and brought back to earth for final research. With that, anything can start to fall apart like a house of cards. For the lovers I like to give some real figures/facts:
* Perseverance must <u>prepare</u> for a human expedition:
	* He maps the <u>geology</u> of Mars. With its RIMFAX radar, the structure of the soil can be measured up to a depth of 10 m. In addition, the camera can take panoramic photos, 3D photos and HD videos.
	* He's trying to get a view of the <u>climate</u> there. With its MEDA, the wind, temperature and humidity can be measured.
	* He tries to determine if there has ever been <u>life</u>. The PIXL can bring soil structures as small as a grain of salt into sharp focus. With the SHERLOC laser, organic materials can be seen.
	* He's testing whether humans can go to Mars. With its MOXIE, <u>oxygen</u> can be produced from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Its predecessors have already mapped potentially liveable environments.
	* It has 2 <u>microphones</u> on board which is always handy. One observes the environment and the other records all the sounds during the work.
	* It has a very mobile <u>robotic arm</u> of 2 m length. At the end there is a drill that can drill holes in the rocks and collect samples. It is hoped that this will fill 43 tubes, which will then be left in a strategic location where they can be fully automated later. A Mars mission with a return flight to Earth (without humans) is planned by the 1930s.
	* And then there is the <u>drone helicopter</u> INGENUITY with a double rotor of 120 cm that has to rotate extremely fast to get into the thin atmosphere of the ground. Some self-contained flights of 2 minutes to a maximum of 10 m altitude and 300 m far should be possible and will serve to map the path of the Perseverance.
* The robot is about 2.7 m wide, 2.2 m high, 3 m long and weighs 1025 kg. A comparison with a <u>passenger car</u> is permeates itself.
* As a power source there is a <u>radioisotope energy system</u>. This energy system produces a reliable stream of electricity day and night. He uses the heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium as his 'fuel'. The power supplied is 110 W at the beginning and is continuously stored in 2 rechargeable Lithium ion batteries. One takes into account an annual wear and tear of only a few percent. The energy system of its predecessors that worked with solar panels (and then became unusable due to the dust) has therefore been permanently improved. From now on, a maximum of 2 km can be travelled daily at a sedentable pace of 150 meters per hour. There are 6 wheels of 0.5 m diameter, each with its own engine and 4 of them can steer. Titanium spokes provide the firmness and an aluminium tread with cleats provides grip so that rocks up to 40 cm can be overcome.

It is a <span style="color: blue;">prophecy</span>, no man is good at it. This article was written long before the possible successful landing of the robot was a fact. This, too, should be thought-provoking.

Yet this writing worked as a kind of liberation, although it leaves a scratch on my youthful soul.
